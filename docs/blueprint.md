- Food Item Input: Allow restaurants, hotels, and caterers to input available food items (e.g., 20 plates of rice, 10 curries).
- Expiry Window Entry: Enable the entry of expiry windows ('Best before 4 hours').
- Location Input: Capture the location of food pickup.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy orange (#D2691E) to evoke feelings of warmth, nourishment, and connection to the earth.
- Background color: Light tan (#F5F5DC) as a neutral backdrop that allows the food imagery and other design elements to stand out, while still supporting the theme.
- Accent color: Olive green (#808000) for buttons and interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for its clean, modern, and readable appearance. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, to bring a touch of computerized feel.
- Use clear and recognizable icons to represent food categories, locations, and expiry times.
- Design a map interface showing the available food locations and optimal routes for volunteers.
- Use smooth transitions and subtle animations to indicate updates to food availability and pickup status.
